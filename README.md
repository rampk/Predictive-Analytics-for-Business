This repository contains the projects of Udacity's [Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/business-analyst-nanodegree--nd008).

### Part 1: Problem Solving with Advanced Analytics

In this part, I learned a structured framework for solving problems with advanced analytics and selecting the most appropriate analytical methodology. More importantly, I learned the difference between descriptive analysis and predictive analysis, which made me read more about descriptive analysis, diagnostic analysis, predictive analysis, and prescriptive analysis.
